# Azure Governance DevOps Generator

## About

The cloud creates new paradigms for the technologies that support the business. These new paradigms also change how those technologies are adopted, managed, and governed. When entire datacenters can be virtually torn down and rebuilt with one line of code executed by an unattended process, we have to rethink traditional approaches. This is especially true for governance.

Cloud governance is an iterative process. For organizations with existing policies that govern on-premises IT environments, cloud governance should complement those policies. However, the level of corporate policy integration between on-premises and the cloud varies depending on cloud governance maturity and a digital estate in the cloud. As the cloud estate changes over time, so do cloud governance processes and policies. The following exercises help you understand how start building your initial governance foundation.

The objective is helping customers to quickly deploy Azure Governance following the best practices using  Azure DevOps board with agile practices.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites: 

1. Create a [DevOps Organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization?view=azure-devops#create-an-organization) or use an existing one.


### Steps

1. Go to [http://aka.ms/governance/generator](http://aka.ms/governance/generator), sign into your DevOps organization and you already will be in the correct template selection for Governance. (Please note that if you click on **Choose template**, this template is available under **Cloud Adoption Framework**);

2. Fill in **Project Name** and select your Organization.

3. Click to **Create Project**.

4. An Azure DevOps project will be created in your organization.

5. In your organization, navigate to the project then click to **Boards**, then on **Backlogs**, you should be able to see **User Stories** and **Tasks** providing guidance on Governance. Bellow is a image with the recommended order to follow:

This should help your team to discuss, agree on acceptance criteria, delegate ownership, create iterations, track the progress and efficiently deploy Azure Governance.
